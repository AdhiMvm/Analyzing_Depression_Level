# Understanding Depression Diagnosis Amongst College Students:

Depression, a prevalent and complex mental health disorder, often eludes early detection and treatment.

A binomial model reveals positive correlations between depression diagnoses and variables such as age, gender, suicidal intent, and PHQ score, though individual cases may vary.
