## Project Summary: Understanding Depression Among College Students

This project investigates depression diagnosis among college students using data from Kaggle, which includes responses from 787 undergraduates at the University of Lahore.

We modeled the likelihood of a depression diagnosis based on the PHQ score, age, and gender using a binomial regression model. The PHQ score is a widely used tool for assessing depression severity, with higher scores indicating more severe symptoms.

### Key Findings

- **PHQ Score**: Each 1-point increase in the PHQ score raises the odds of a depression diagnosis by about 14%.
- **Gender**: Females have approximately 45% higher odds of being diagnosed with depression compared to males.
- **Age**: Each additional year of age increases the likelihood of a depression diagnosis by roughly 16%.

These findings underscore the significant impact of symptom severity, gender, and age on depression diagnosis, highlighting the need for targeted mental health support.
