It can be difficult to recognize the signs and symptoms, and many people struggle to get the help they need. This project is dedicated to analyzing some of the factors that might help us predict depression.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe plot above suggests that there might not be a strong connection between a person’s weight and their risk of depression. This means that having a higher or lower BMI doesn’t necessarily mean someone will experience depression."
