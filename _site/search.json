    "text": "The data for this project is sourced from Kaggle. It consists of responses from 787 undergraduate students at the University of Lahore and is inspired by the Beck Depression and Beck Anxiety Inventories. This rich dataset captures a wide range of depression and anxiety symptoms, offering valuable insights into mental health among college students. By analyzing this data, we can explore various machine learning approaches to classify and predict the severity of these conditions. This can ultimately contribute to better understanding and potentially improving mental health support for students."

    "text": "Depression is a serious mental health condition that affects millions of people around the world. It can be difficult to recognize the signs and symptoms, and many people struggle to get the help they need.This project investigates depression diagnosis among students using data from Kaggle, which includes responses from 787 undergraduates at the University of Lahore.\nWe modeled the likelihood of a depression diagnosis based on the Public Health Questionnaire(PHQ) score, age, and gender. The PHQ score, a common tool for assessing depression severity, indicates more severe symptoms with higher scores. Using a binomial regression model, we quantified how these factors influence depression probability among students aged 18 to 30.\nOur analysis shows that each 1-point increase in the PHQ score raises the odds of a depression diagnosis by approximately 14%. Additionally, females have about 45% higher odds of being diagnosed with depression compared to males. These findings highlight the significant impact of symptom severity and gender on depression diagnosis, emphasizing the need for targeted support and interventions for students."

In simpler terms, women are about 45% more likely to be diagnosed with depression than men, assuming all other factors remain the same. This finding is specific to college students aged 18 to 30.\n\nAge:\n\nOdds Ratio: ( e^{_3} ) where ( _3 = 0.15 )\nExplanation: Each additional year of age increases the odds of having a depression diagnosis by about 16%. This means that for each year someone gets older, their odds of being diagnosed with depression increase by 16%, with other factors held constant. This finding is specific to college students aged 18 to 30."
